# Morphology

Most of Ithkuil's categories have been transformed into [modifiers](modifiers.md), the reincarnation of derivational suffixes. Others have been replaced with [derived roots](roots.md), which operates as a more powerful SSD. The rest have been, for the most part, vastly simplified.

## Case

Yalbi has only twelve cases.

| No. | Vc value | Abbreviation |        Name        | Use                                                                         |
|:---:|:--------:|:------------:|:------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  |    a     |    `OBL`     |      Oblique       | Content                                                                     |
|  2  |    ei    |    `IND`     |      Inducive      | Agent + patient                                                             |
|  3  |    i     |    `ABS`     |     Absolutive     | Patient                                                                     |
|  4  |    e     |    `ERG`     |      Ergative      | Agent                                                                       |
|  5  |    ai    |    `EFF`     |    Effectuative    | Enabler                                                                     |
|  6  |    ie    |    `AFF`     |     Affective      | Experiencer                                                                 |
|  7  |    oi    |    `DAT`     |       Dative       | Indirect object                                                             |
|  8  |   aie    |    `DER`     |     Derivative     | Inanimate force or non-deliberate stimulus                                  |
|  9  |   eia    |    `CPS`     |    Compositive     | Thing consumed                                                              |
| 10  |   oia    |    `RSL`     |    Resultative     | Result ("into X" as in "transformed into a frog" OR "with the result of X") |
| 11  |    au    |    `FUN`     |      Functive      | Modifies verb                                                               |
| 12  |    o     |    `CORn`    | Correlative (next) | Modifies next noun                                                          |
| 12  |    u     |    `CORp`    | Correlative (prev) | Modifies previous noun                                                      |

All of Ithkuil's other cases have been replaced with modifiers, used in conjunction with one of the `FUN` Functive or `COR` Correlative cases.

Without any relevant suffixes, the Functive case takes on the meaning "characterized by X" and the Correlative case means "in a manner characterized by X." Some words (e.g. numbers) have their own

## Illocution

Yalbi's Illocution merges Ithkuil's Illocution and Sanction.

| Abbreviation | Name                 | Use                                                                     |
|:------------:|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `ASR`     | Assertive            | Neutral proposition of fact                                             |
|    `ALG`     | Allegative           | Proposition open to challenge/refutation                                |
|    `IPU`     | Imputative           | Rebuttable assertion otherwise assumed to be true                       |
|    `THR`     | Theoretical          | Testable hypothesis/theory                                              |
|    `EXV`     | Expatiative          | Hypothesis/theory that may not be verifiable                            |
|    `AXM`     | Axiomatic            | Objectively true, universal fact                                        |
|    `DIR`     | Directive            | Command ("Make it happen such that X")                                  |
|    `IRG`     | Interrogative        | Question (used with <some suffix that hasn't been invented yet> [TODO]) |
|    `ADM`     | Admonitive           | Warning ("Be wary of X")                                                |
|    `HOR`     | Hortative            | Wishing ("If only X")                                                   |
|    `DEC`     | Declarative          | Formal announcement; effecting a change per se                          |
|    `FRM`     | Framed               | The start of a [case-frame](syntax.md#case-frames)                      |
|   `FRM-IRG   | Framed interrogative | The start of an [Interrogative case-frame](syntax.md#case-frames)       |

On its own, `IRG` Interrogative illocution asks a true/false question: "Is X true?" Alternatively, `IRG` can be used with certain suffixes to ask other types of questions. Likewise, `FRM-IRG` Framed interrogative illocution is translated as a true/false indirect question ("whether X is true") and can be used with certain suffixes to ask other types of questions.

## Validation

Yalbi's Validations resemble 2011 Ithkuil's original Validations more than its current ones. Note that many of these are not permitted with certain Illocutions.

| Abbreviation | Name         | Use                                                   |
|:------------:|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|    `CNF`     | Confirmative | Direct observation/knowledge; verifiable by others    |
|    `AFM`     | Affirmative  | Direct observation/knowledge; unknown verifiability   |
|    `RPT`     | Reportative  | Direct observation/knowledge; unverifiable            |
|    `INF`     | Inferential  | Inference                                             |
|    `ITU`     | Intuitive    | Intuition/feeling                                     |
|    `TS-V`    |              | Trustworthy source; verifiable                        |
|    `TS-U`    |              | Trustworthy source; unknown verifiability             |
|    `TS-N`    |              | Trustworthy source; unverifiable                      |
|    `US-V`    |              | Unknown source trustworthiness; verifiable            |
|    `US-U`    |              | Unknown source trustworthiness; unknown verifiability |
|    `US-N`    |              | Unknown source trustworthiness; unverifiable          |
|    `NS-V`    |              | Untrustworthy source; verifiable                      |
|    `NS-U`    |              | Untrustworthy source; unknown verifiability           |
|    `NS-N`    |              | Untrustworthy source; unverifiable                    |

The abbreviations for the latter nine Validations have been changed from Ithkuil to be more regular and thus easier to remember. "Name" and "use" for these nine are the same.

`CNF` Confirmative is also used as a sort of default Validation for those Illocutions where Validation is not applicable.

With `IRG` Interrogative illocution, Validation might be translated as "I [think/heard/assume] that X is the case; is it so?" (with no applicable suffix) or "I [think/heard/assume] the answer to the following question: X?" (with an applicable suffix). In general, Illocution and Validation operate in parallel rather than modifying one another.

## Perspective

Perspective has been copied almost directly from Ithkuil.

| Abbreviation | Name      | Nominal meaning       | Verbal meaning                                                          |
|:------------:|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     `M`      | Monadic   | Singular              | An event occurring in the present context (simple present tense)        |
|     `U`      | Unbounded | Plural                | An event that does not occur in the present context (simple past tense) |
|     `N`      | Nomic     | All instances ever    | Universal rule (eg. "Gravity is one of the fundamental forces")         |
|     `A`      | Abstract  | The idea of X, X-ness | "Timeless" verb form (infinitives, gerundives, etc.)                    |

Abstract perspective is generally not used with main verbs.

Collective nouns are shown either by derivations or using <some suffix that hasn't been invented yet>. [TODO]

Nouns may be marked for perspective only once, at the end of the word. `DYN` verbs are marked for perspective only once, at the beginning of the word. `STA` verbs may be marked for perspective at both the beginning and the end of the word; the first marking is applied verbally, and the second is applied nominally.

Perspective is applied nominally or verbally based on grammatical role, not derivative root.

Here are some examples of Perspective in use:

| Gloss                                  | English                          |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| _to like_-DYN-N _I_-AFF _cookie_-**M** | "I like a cookie."               |
| _to like_-DYN-N _I_-AFF _cookie_-**U** | "I like [some] cookies."         |
| _to like_-DYN-N _I_-AFF _cookie_-**N** | "I like [all] cookies."          |
| _to like_-DYN-N _I_-AFF _cookie_-**A** | "I like cookie-ness."            |
| _to jump_-DYN-**M** _I_-IND            | "I am jumping."                  |
| _to jump_-DYN-**U** _I_-IND            | "I was jumping."                 |
| _to jump_-DYN-**N** _I_-IND            | "I jump [in general]."           |
| _to jump_-DYN-**A**-FRM _I_-IND        | "the idea of me jumping"         |
| _necktie_-STA-**M**-**M** _it_-OBL     | "It's a necktie."                |
| _necktie_-STA-**M**-**U** _it_-OBL     | "It's [some] neckties."          |
| _necktie_-STA-**M**-**N** _it_-OBL     | "It's [all] neckties." **?**     |
| _necktie_-STA-**M**-**A** _it_-OBL     | "It is necktie-ness." **?**      |
| _necktie_-STA-**U**-**M** _it_-OBL     | "It was a necktie."              |
| _necktie_-STA-**N**-**M** _it_-OBL     | "It is a necktie [in general]."  |
| _necktie_-STA-**A**-**M**-FRM _it_-OBL | "the idea of it being a necktie" |

The statements marked with **?** are logically questionable, but grammatically valid.

## Essence

Yalbi's Essence is identical to Ithkuil's Essence, except that `RPV` Representative has been renamed to `RPS` Representational, to better match `NRM` Normal.

| Abbreviation |       Name       | Use                                                             |
|:------------:|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `NRM`     |      Normal      | A real thing that exists (or a real event)                      |
|    `RPS`     | Representational | Something which doesn't really exist (or doesn't really happen) |

## Context

Yalbi's Context is similar to Ithkuil's Context, but without the Amalgamative or Functional. Additionally, `RPS` Representative has been renamed to `MTR` Metaphorical to reduce confusion.

| Abbreviation |     Name     | Use                                                 | Example                      |
|:------------:|:------------:|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|    `EXS`     | Existential  | Default context; no special meaning                 | "It's a cat."                |
|    `MTR`     | Metaphorical | A metaphor for something; not to be taken literally | "It's a (metaphorical) cat." |

Note that the Metaphorical context operates independently from Essence; one can have a metaphor for a thing which really exists, or a metaphor for a thing which does not exist.

Yalbi's `MTR` Metaphorical essence is based on to Ithkuil's `RPS` Representational context, while Yalbi's `RPS` Representational essence is based on to Ithkuil's `RPV` Representative essence. Confused yet?

## Case-frame

Yalbi uses case-frames to represent subordinate clauses. A case-frame always begins a "framed verb," a verb with [Case](#case) instead of [Illocution](#illocution) and [Validation](#validation). A case-frame ends with <some suffix that hasn't been invented yet> [TODO]. [TODO] Yalbi has two types of case-frames: normal (`FRM`) and interrogative (`FRM-IRG`). Interrogative case-frames are used to ask indirect questions; normal case-frames are used for all other purposes. Other than that, case-frames work exactly as they do in Ithkuil, so just go and read [JQ's explanation](http://ithkuil.net/05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o4) for now.
