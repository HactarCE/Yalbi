# Pronouns

Pronouns are formed by using the normal [formative structure](morphophonology.md#formative) with the root **pa** and a stem from the following chart. First and second person referents are listed along the top; third person referents are listed along the left.

| Pronoun stems | none | 1  | 2m | 1+2m | 2u | 1+2u |
|---------------|:----:|:--:|:--:|:----:|:--:|:----:|

| 3ui           |  n   | rd | rg |  rb  | ns |  nc  |

Key:

* a = Animate

There are also a few additional forms:

|:----:|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|  lf  | Universal animate    | "everyone"                                                     |
|  rf  | Universal inanimate  | "everything"                                                   |
|  z   | Impersonal animate   | [Generic "you"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_you)     |
|  j   | Impersonal inanimate | Generic "something"                                            |
|  b   | Collective           | Nomic perspective                                              |
|  d   | Abstract             | Abstract perspective                                           |
|  g   | Obviative            | 4th person; 3rd person other than the one previously mentioned |

If a pronoun has only one case and no modifiers, CVr can be removed, leaving just CVc + Cs.
