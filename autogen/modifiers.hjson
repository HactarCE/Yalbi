        This modifier cannot be used in type 3. ([TODO] There should be a mechanism for using the carrier word as a modifier, but it will not be using `CAR`.) This modifier must appear at the end of a word. The last word of the carried segment is given rising tone. ([TODO] Handle quoting tonal languages?) This modifier is used in type 2 if quoting a proper noun; otherwise type 1 is used.
