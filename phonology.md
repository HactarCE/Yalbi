# Phonology

Yalbi's phonology is quite barebones compared to Ithkuil, and even compared to [my attempt to reform it](https://github.com/HactarCE/I.tkuil).

**.n** and **.e** may be used as ASCII-friendly alternatives to **ŋ** and **ə**.

* [Vowels](#vowels)
* [Stress and Tone](#stress-and-tone)
* [Phonotactics](#phonotactics)

## Consonants

Where plosives and fricatives appear in pairs, the one on the left is unvoiced and the one on the right is voiced. Otherwise it is unvoiced.

|              | Nasal | Plosive | Fricative | Approximant |
|--------------|:-----:|:-------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Bilabial     |   m   |   p b   |           |             |
| Labiodental  |       |         |    f v    |             |
| Alveolar     |   n   |   t d   |    s z    |      r      |
| Postalveolar |       |         |    c j    |     (r)     |
| Velar/uvular |       |   k g   |     x     |             |
| Glottal      |       |         |     h     |             |
| Lateral      |       |         |           |      l      |

The alveolar approximant **r** may also be pronounced as an alveolar tap.

Word-initial nasals that do not form valid [syllable onsets](#syllable-onset) are pronounced as their own syllables. For example, **msral** is pronounced as **m-sral**.

Unvoiced plosives may optionally be aspirated when followed immediately by a vowel.

## Vowels

Front and central vowels are unrounded; back vowels are rounded.

|      |   Front   |  Central  |   Back    |
|------|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| High | i /i~ɪ~j/ |           | u /u~ʊ~w/ |
| Mid  |   e /ɛ/   |           | o /o~oʊ/  |
| Low  |           | a /a~ɑ~ə/ |           |

Yalbi has four dipthongs.

* ai /aɪ/
* ei /eɪ~e/
* oi /oɪ/
* au /aʊ/

The following eight vowel combinations may be pronounced either as two separate syllables, or as diphthongs. The timing of the transition doesn't matter; as long as they are distinct from every other vowel/diphthong, pronounce these however you want.

* ia /ia~ja/
* ie /iɛ~jɛ/
* io /io~jo/
* iu /iu~ju/
* ua /ua~wa/
* ue /uɛ~wɛ/
* ui /ui~wi/
* uo /uo~wo/

These two vowel combinations are always pronounced as two separate syllables.

* oa
* oe

Three-vowel combinations are always disyllabic, and may be pronounced either as a vowel followed by a diphthong, or as a diphthong followed by a vowel. There are sixteen such three-vowel combinations:

* aia, aie, aio, aiu
* eia, eie, eio, eiu
* oia, oie, oio, oiu
* aua, aue, aui, auo

[TODO] Probably most of these won't be used, so remove the ones that aren't needed?

When an affix containing a disyllabic vowel combination is said to be stressed, only the second syllable of the vowel combination is actually stressed.

## Stress and Tone

Neither syllable stress nor tone is morphologically significant. Each word type has its own stress rules. Tone is used to convey grammatical information or for emphasis. [TODO]

## Phonotactics

_Readers who are not interested in helping to develop Yalbi or who do not care for formal linguistic stuff may want to skip this section._

The phonotactics listed below are written by a complete newbie and probably have a ton of flaws. If you find something in here that seems really hard to pronounce, or notice something simple that I've missed, or find a Yalbi word that does not follow these rules, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/HactarCE/Yalbi/issues/new) or let me know personally.

Syllables consist of three parts: [onset](#syllable-onset), [nucleus](#syllable-nucleus), and [coda](#syllable-coda). Additionally, all words must obey certain [phonotactic constraints](#phonotactic-constraints). Unless otherwise stated, the glottal stop **'** and glottal fricative **h** are not included in any generalized group below.

### Syllable Onset

The onset of a syllable can follow any of these patterns:

* Any consonant (including **h**)
* Nasal + approximant
* Fricative + approximant
* **s**/**c** + nasal
* **s**/**c** + unvoiced plosive (+ approximant)
* Unvoiced plosive + **s**/**c** (+ approximant)
* **dz**/**dj** (+ approximant)
* **pf**/**bv** (+ approximant)

Alternatively, if the syllable is not word-initial and is preceded by an empty coda, a syllable onset may be empty.

These rules permit a total of **93** syllable onsets (not including the empty onset).

### Syllable Nucleus

The nucleus of a syllable can follow any of these patterns:

* Any vowel
* Any diphthong
* Any nasal or approximant (if the nucleus and coda are both empty)

### Syllable Coda

* Any consonant
* (approximant +) Nasal + fricative (excluding **x**)
* approximant + plosive/fricative
* Unvoiced plosive + **s**/**c**
* Voiced plosive + **z**/**j**
* **s**/**c** + unvoiced plosive
* **z**/**j** + voiced plosive
* (approximant +) **mp**/**nt**/**ŋk**
* (approximant +) **np**

Alternatively, the syllable coda may be empty.

These rules permit a total of **135** syllable codas.

### Phonotactic Constraints

The following phonotactic rules must be obeyed:

* Two consonants with the same place and manner of articulation (voicedness being ignored) cannot appear adjacent in a word
