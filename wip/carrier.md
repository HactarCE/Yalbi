## Carrier

The carrier word is a way to include loanwords, proper nouns, or quotation in Yalbi speech. The carrier word is not capable of exhibiting modifiers on its own, however it can be preceded by an [detached modifier](#detached-modifier).

The carrier word has two forms: unintegrated and integrated. The first of these is used for loanwords and quotations treated as nouns. The second is used for quotations directly integrated into the sentence.

| Bob says that Sam owns an elephant.   | _to say_-[verb] CR-IND-(Bob) _to own_-OBL-[framed verb] CR-AFF-(Sam) _elephant_-ABS       | The unintegrated carrier word is used to include Sam and Bob in the sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Bob says, "Sam owns an elephant."     | _to say_-[verb] CR-IND-(Bob) CR-OBL-(Sam owns an elephant)                                | Direct speech is quoted using the unintegrated carrier, since the entire phrase is being treated as a collection of words; i.e. it does not matter grammatically what is conveyed by the words. (A different carrier type would be used depending on whether the quotation is in Yalbi or another language.) |
| Bob says that Sam owns an "elephant." | _to say_-[verb] CR-IND-(Bob) _to own_-OBL-[framed verb] CR-AFF-(Sam) ICR-(_elephant_-OBL) | "Elephant" is Bob's word that the speaker is using here. Perhaps Sam really only has an imaginary elephant, but Bob says that it is real (hence the implied Normal essence).                                                                                                                                 |

Affixes within parenthetical groups are optional.

* The presence of slot 1 indicates that the word is operating as a verb (though the carried word need not necessarily be a verb; see [Syntax](syntax.md))
* Slots 2 and 3 are required; all others are optional

The carrier word has a second form

If the carrier word conveys a nominal (noun) phrase which is integrated into the rest of the sentence, Vc is replaced with the value **oe**. Otherwise

In gloss, the unintegrated carrier is denoted with the abbreviation `CR`.

### Integrated Carrier

The integrated carrier is used when a quoted word or phrase is part of the sentence. Unlike the unintegrated carrier, morphological information is entirely contained within the quotation; the integrated carrier serves only as a pair of quotation marks to show that what follows are not the speaker's own words. Certain morphological markers (such as case) may be modified from the original phrase in order to fit in grammatically. The integrated carrier is **oe**.

In gloss, the integrated carrier is denoted with the abbreviation `ICR`.
