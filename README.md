# Yalbi

After trying to reform [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/) and discovering several deeply rooted morphological ambiguities and redundancies, I decided to try to create my own language using my favorite parts of Ithkuil as a starting point. The result is Yalbi, an open-source morphophonological simplification and relexification of Ithkuil.

Long-term stuff:

- [ ] Searchable lexicon

"… it’s going to be a long time before I begin working on [a reform of Ithkuil] – we’re talking many years, maybe even as much as a decade from now. So if that’s just too long to wait for you young whippersnappers, then I suggest some of you get together and attempt the project yourselves. Just don’t call it anything using the name “Ithkuil” such as “Reformed Ithkuil” or “New Ithkuil” or “Ithkuilido”, etc. However, please do me the courtesy of acknowledging me and my work as your inspirational/derivational source, i.e., the introduction to any website or book, etc. should say something like “this work is inspired by and (partially) based upon…”, etc." - John Quijada ([source](https://www.reddit.com/4z1h58/))

Let it be hereby stated that Yalbi's morphology and lexicon are both heavily based on Ithkuil, and that any ideas or lexical entries taken from or inspired by Ithkuil are marked as such. In no other way is Yalbi affiliated with John Quijada or Ithkuil.
