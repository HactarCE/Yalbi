Modifiers are the adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions of Yalbi. They are essentially the same as Ithkuil's derivational suffixes, but play an even heavier role than in Ithkuil.

Every modifier can be marked for two categories: type and degree. There are three types:

* Type 1 - Modifies the word (incidental property)
* Type 2 - Modifies the word (intrinsic property)
* Type 3 - Modifies the next modifier

There are nine degrees, which generally form spectrum from least to greatest. Some suffixes have their own specific interpretations for each of these categories, but they will usually adhere to this outline. Degree and type are both conveyed by [Vm](affixes.md#cvm).

| Vm     | Degree 1 | Degree 2 | Degree 3 | Degree 4 | Degree 5 | Degree 6 | Degree 7 | Degree 8 | Degree 9 |
|--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Type 1 |    au    |    ai    |    oi    |    ei    |    a     |    e     |    o     |    i     |    u     |
| Type 3 |    iu    |    ia    |    io    |    ie    |    oa    |    ue    |    uo    |    ua    |    ui    |
| Type 2 |   aiu    |   aia    |   aio    |   aie    |    oe    |   aue    |   auo    |   aua    |   aui    |

A modifier can be used as a root
