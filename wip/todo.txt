fix all verbs have case (still prevent invalid illoc+validation combinations)
- maybe include aspect as vowel?
- need two different verb forms: to want, and to be a want (former is invalid for most stems)

to be X (noun meaning)
to do X (verb meaning -- not valid for most stems)
to be the doing of X (use modifier)

- also case-frame stuff!

move "integrated carrier" and call it something else maybe?

"root incorp" using type 2 case suffix?
CV_suffix CV_root C_deriv V_something?

interrogative = requesting information (= please tell me about X) ?

- spatial version of TPI
  - at a single point
  - over a small area
  - over a large area
  - ubiquitous(ly)
- Degree of Consensus (see MD24)
