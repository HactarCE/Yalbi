# Phonology

Yalbi's phonology is quite barebones compared to Ithkuil, having only 18 consonants, five vowels, and four diphthongs.

### Vowel Pronunciation

### Diphthongs

These vowel conjuncts are always pronounced as diphthongs.

### Optional Diphthongs

These vowel conjuncts may be pronounced either as diphthongs, as separate syllables, or as an approximant followed by a vowel. The timing of the transition does not matter.

| Romanization |   IPA   |
|:------------:|:-------:|
|      ia      | /ia~ja/ |
|      ie      | /iɛ~jɛ/ |
|      io      | /io~jo/ |
|      iu      | /iu~ju/ |
|      ua      | /ua~wa/ |
|      ue      | /uɛ~wɛ/ |
|      ui      | /ui~wi/ |
|      uo      | /uo~wo/ |

For syllable stress purposes, these count as diphthongs. Only the second letter can carry an acute accent for tone marking.

### Disyllabic vowel conjuncts

The vowel combinations **oa** and **oe** are always pronounced as two separate syllables.

The following three-vowel conjuncts may be pronounced either as a diphthong followed by a vowel, or as a vowel followed by a diphthong:

* aia, aie, aio, aiu
* eia, eie, eio, eiu
* oia, oie, oio, oiu
* aua, aue, aui, auo

## Stress

Syllable stress is not morphologically significant in Yalbi.

Two-syllable words are stressed on the first syllable.  
Words with three or more syllables are stressed on the second syllable.

## Tone

Yalbi has two tone registers: falling and rising. Falling tone is the default and is not marked. Rising tone can be indicated in a number of ways:

* A forward slash `/` preceding a word; e.g. **/amal**
* An acute accent `á` over the stressed syllable; e.g. **amál**
* Tone markings following a word; e.g. **amal˧˥**

Neither syllable stress nor tone is morphologically significant. Each word type has its own stress rules. Tone is used to convey grammatical information or for emphasis. [TODO]

## Phonotactics

_Readers who are not interested in helping to develop Yalbi or who do not care for formal linguistic stuff may want to skip this section. Additionally, everything described below is very likely to be revised later._

The phonotactics listed below are written by a complete newbie and probably have a ton of flaws. If you find something in here that seems really hard to pronounce, or notice something simple that I've missed, or find a Yalbi word that does not follow these rules, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/HactarCE/Yalbi/issues/new) or notify me some other way.

Syllables consist of three parts: [onset](#syllable-onset), [nucleus](#syllable-nucleus), and [coda](#syllable-coda). Additionally, all words must obey certain [phonotactic constraints](#phonotactic-constraints). Unless otherwise stated, the glottal fricative **h** is not included in any generalized group below, and **r** is considered an approximant.

### Syllable Onset

The onset of a syllable can follow any of these patterns:

* Any consonant (including **h**)
* Nasal + approximant
* Fricative + approximant
* **s**/**c** + nasal
* **s**/**c** + unvoiced plosive (+ approximant)
* Unvoiced plosive + **s**/**c** (+ approximant)
* **dz**/**dj** (+ approximant)
* **pf**/**bv** (+ approximant)

Alternatively, if the syllable is not word-initial and is preceded by an empty coda, a syllable onset may be empty.

These rules permit a total of **93** syllable onsets (not including the empty onset).

### Syllable Nucleus

The nucleus of a syllable can follow any of these patterns:

* Any vowel
* Any diphthong
* Any nasal or approximant (if the nucleus and coda are both empty)

### Syllable Coda

* Any consonant
* (approximant +) Nasal + fricative (excluding **x**)
* approximant + plosive/fricative
* Unvoiced plosive + **s**/**c**
* Voiced plosive + **z**/**j**
* **s**/**c** + unvoiced plosive
* **z**/**j** + voiced plosive
* (approximant +) **mp**/**nt**/**ŋk**
* (approximant +) **np**

Alternatively, the syllable coda may be empty.

These rules permit a total of **135** syllable codas.

### Phonotactic Constraints

The following phonotactic rules must be obeyed:

* Two consonants with the same place and manner of articulation (voicedness being ignored) cannot appear adjacent in a word
