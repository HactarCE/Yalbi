# Roots

_This file was automatically generated by [`compile_lexicon.py`](autogen/compile_lexicon.py). Do not make changes to this file directly; instead modify [`roots_template.md`](autogen/roots_template.md) or [`roots.hjson`](autogen/roots.hjson)._

Each "root" in Yalbi consists of a vowel and a consonant, and has a number of consonantal "stems" (the default of which is **l**). Most roots do not have all stems defined.

This is somewhat similar to Ithkuil's pattern/stem/designation system, but is more flexible and eliminates the need for a stem-specific derivational suffix (SSD).

The following consonant clusters may not be used in roots (without other consonants): **h**, **m**, **n**, **p**, **t**, **k**, **sp**, **st**, **sk**, **x**.

All of Yalbi's roots are listed below.
