# Roots

Each "root" in Yalbi consists of a vowel and a consonant, and has a number of consonantal "stems" (the default of which is **l**). Most roots do not have all stems defined.

This is somewhat similar to Ithkuil's pattern/stem/designation system, but is more flexible and eliminates the need for a stem-specific derivational suffix (SSD).

The following consonant clusters may not be used alone in roots: **m**

All of Yalbi's roots are listed below.
