# Morphology

Most of Ithkuil's categories have been reformed into [derivational suffixes](suffixes.md); most of the rest have been modified somewhat.

* [Case](#case)
* [Case-frame](#case-frame)
* [Function](#function)
* [Illocution](#illocution)
* [Validation](#validation)
* [Perspective](#perspective)
* [Essence](#essence)
* [Context](#context)

## Case

Like Ithkuil, Yalbi has nearly a hundred cases. Each case is declined somewhat like a suffix, having three types. A brief description of each case follows. Most of these cases are identical to their Ithkuil counterparts, however some cases have been eliminated or moved and some have been replaced.

### Comparison cases

[TODO]

## Illocution

Yalbi's Illocution merges Ithkuil's Illocution and Sanction.

| Abbreviation | Name          | Use                                                                     |

## Validation

Validation identifies how the speaker knows the information that is being communicated. Validation has been greatly expanded compared to Ithkuil. Note that Validation is only used with Assertive, Allegative, and Imputative illocutions.

| Abbreviation | Name          | Use                                  |

|     `A`      | Abstract  | The idea of X; X-ness   | "Timeless" verb form (infinitives, gerundives, etc.)            |

Abstract perspective is not permitted with main verbs.

## Essence

Yalbi's Essence is identical to Ithkuil's Essence, except that `RPV` Representative has been renamed to `RPS` Representational, to better match `NRM` Normal.

| Abbreviation |       Name       | Use                                                             |
|:------------:|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `NRM`     |      Normal      | A real thing that exists (or a real event)                      |
|    `RPS`     | Representational | Something which doesn't really exist (or doesn't really happen) |

## Context

Yalbi's Context is similar to Ithkuil's Context, but without the Amalgamative or Functional. Additionally, `RPS` Representational has been renamed to `MTR` Metaphorical to reduce confusion.

| Abbreviation |     Name     | Use                                 | Example                      |

|    `EXS`     | Existential  | Default context; no special meaning | "It's a cat."                |
|    `MTR`     | Metaphorical | A metaphor for something            | "It's a (metaphorical) cat." |

Note that the Metaphorical context operates independently from Essence; one can have a metaphor for a thing which really exists, or a metaphor for a thing which does not exist.

Yalbi's `MTR` Metaphorical essence is based on to Ithkuil's `RPS` Representational context, while Yalbi's `RPS` Representational essence is based on to Ithkuil's `RPV` Representative essence. Confused yet?

## Case-frame

Yalbi uses case-frames to emulate subordinate clauses. A case-frame always begins a "framed verb," a verb with [Case](#case) instead of [Illocution](#illocution) and [Validation](#validation). The final word of a case frame carries rising tone; thus a one-word case-frame consists of a single verb with rising tone. Alternatively, the word **o** may be used to end a case-frame. [TODO] Case-frames work exactly as they do in Ithkuil, so just go and read [JQ's explanation](http://ithkuil.net/05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o4) for now.
