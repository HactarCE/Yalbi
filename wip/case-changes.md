## Removed cases

* ACT Activative (modalities don't need no special case no more!)
* ATT Attributive (use ABS or AFF modifying a noun)
* ABE Abessive (use negation + COM)

## Moved cases

* ESS Essive - Moved from ASSOCIATIVE to TRANSRELATIVE
* IDP Interdependent - Moved from ASSOCIATIVE to POSSESSIVE
* All the Utilitative cases - Moved from ASSOCIATIVE to new UTILITATIVE category
* Renamed "Vocative" category to "Interjective" category (VOC case is still called Vocative)
* some others probably

## New cases

* ITJ Interjective - Interjection ("**Time-out!**" or "Safe!" or informal answers to questions)
* APP Appositive - [Appositive](http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/appositive.htm)
