# Yalbi

After trying to reform [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/) and discovering several deeply rooted morphological flaws and ambiguities, I decided to try to create my own language using my favorite parts of Ithkuil as a starting point. The result is Yalbi, an open-source morphophonological simplification and relexification of Ithkuil.

* [Morphology](morphology.md)
* [Morphophonology](morphophonology.md)
* [Affixes](affixes.md)
* [Roots](roots.md)
* [Modifiers](modifiers.md)

[TODO] Make a more welcoming README, a learning guide, and a "changelog" for people who already know Ithkuil
