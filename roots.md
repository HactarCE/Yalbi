Yalbi's root system is somewhat complex. Each consonantal root has a number of "derivative roots," each of which is assigned an additional consonant. The default derivative root is assigned to **l**. Each derivative root can also be declined according to Pattern, Stem, and Designation. Each designation (`FML` Formal or `IFL` Informal) contains three patterns (numbered from 1 to 3), which in turn each contain three stems (also numbered 1-3). In general, the first stem of a pattern and the first pattern of a designation are more general, while the subsequent patterns or stems are more specific.

The following consonantal forms may not be used for roots: **m**

All of Yalbi's roots are listed below.
