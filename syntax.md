# Syntax

## Parts of Speech

In general, any word that carries Case other than `FUN` Functive or `COR` Correlative is syntactically considered to be noun.

A Framed verb is considered to be a verb only within its own case-frame; in the surrounding clause or sentence, it is a noun.

Detached modifiers with the `ITJ` Interjective role are considered interjections.

Detached modifiers with the `ADV` Adverbial role, as well as formatives, pronouns, or carrier words with the `FUN` Functive case, are considered adverbs.

Detached modifiers with one of the `ADJ` Adjectival roles, as well as formatives, pronouns, or carrier words with one of the `COR` Correlative cases, are considered adjectives.

## Word Order

Since verbs and nouns are morphophonologically distinct, and nouns carry Case, word order is mostly free in Yalbi. Typically the verb will come first in a sentence, followed by its participants. If a particular word is emphasized, that word should appear before the verb.

Case-frames always begin with a verb and end with <this modifier that hasn't been invented yet> [TODO], either on a formative or as an detached modifier.

Adjectives (as defined above in [Parts of Speech](#parts-of-speech)) must always come either before or after the word they modify.

## Modifiers

Type 1 and type 2 modifiers are syntactically treated the same, except that type 2 modifiers take precedence over type 1. Type 3 modifiers always modify the next type 1 or type 2 modifier, except when they appear at the end of a word with no subsequent type 1 or type 2 modifiers. This is only allowed for detached modifiers with the `ADJn` role; in these situations, the type 3 modifier(s) modify the subsequent formative's case. A type 3 modifier never modifies another type 3 modifier.

## Precedence of Morphological Categories

Morphological categories are conceptually applied in the following order:

1. Root + PSD
2. Type 2 modifiers attached to a word (left-to-right) *
3. Type 1 modifiers attached to a word (left-to-right) *
4. Perspective
5. Type 2 detached modifiers preceding a word (left-to-right) *
6. Type 1 detached modifiers preceding a word (left-to-right) *
7. Validation
8. Essence
9. Context
10. Type 2 detached modifiers following a word (left-to-right) *
11. Type 1 detached modifiers following a word (left-to-right) *
10. Illocution
11. Case
12. Type 3 detached modifiers preceding a word (and not followed by a type 1 or type 2 modifier)

\* Including any immediately preceding type 3 modifiers
