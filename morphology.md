# Morphology

Most of Ithkuil's categories have been transformed into [modifiers](modifiers.md), the reincarnation of derivational suffixes. Others have been replaced with [derived roots](roots.md), which operates as a more powerful SSD. The rest have been, for the most part, vastly simplified.

* [Case](#case)
* [Case-frame](#case-frame)

## Case

Like Ithkuil, Yalbi has nearly a hundred cases. Each case is declined somewhat like a modifier, having three types, however the endings are different from modifiers. A brief description of each case follows. Most of these cases are identical to their Ithkuil counterparts, however some cases have been eliminated or moved and some have been replaced.

### Comparison cases

[TODO]

## Case-frame

Case-frame is Yalbi's mechanism for emulating subordinate clauses. [Here's an explanation.](syntax.md#case-frames) [TODO] Case frame is marked in gloss as `FRM`.

## Function

Yalbi's Function serves a similar purpose to the corresponding category in Ithkuil. Only verbs carry Function.

| Abbreviation | Name        | Use                             | Example                |
|:------------:|-------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
|    `STA`     | Stative     | To be [verb]ing; state of being | To be wearing a bowtie |
|    `DYN`     | Dynamic     | To [verb]; action               | To wear a bowtie       |
|    `MNF`     | Manifestive | To be [noun]; class membership  | To be a bowtie         |

Most stems contain both a "verbal" (STA/DYN) and "nominal" (MNF) definition. For those that do not contain a verbal definition, Stative and Dynamic function may be translated as "to be functioning as X" and "to function as X" respectively. [TODO] Give more details; clarify the difference between STA and DYN, and make sure MNF isn't used as a cop-out solution to translating "be." Also explain where I hid DSC after murdering it.

## Illocution

Yalbi's Illocution merges Ithkuil's Illocution and Sanction.

| Abbreviation | Name                 | Use                                                                     |
|:------------:|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `ASR`     | Assertive            | Neutral proposition of fact                                             |
|    `ALG`     | Allegative           | Proposition open to challenge/refutation                                |
|    `IPU`     | Imputative           | Rebuttable assertion otherwise assumed to be true                       |
|    `THR`     | Theoretical          | Testable hypothesis/theory                                              |
|    `EXV`     | Expatiative          | Hypothesis/theory that may not be verifiable                            |
|    `AXM`     | Axiomatic            | Objectively true, universal fact                                        |
|    `DIR`     | Directive            | Command ("Make it happen such that X")                                  |
|    `IRG`     | Interrogative        | Question (used with <some suffix that hasn't been invented yet> [TODO]) |
|    `ADM`     | Admonitive           | Warning ("Be wary of X")                                                |
|    `HOR`     | Hortative            | Wishing ("If only X")                                                   |
|    `DEC`     | Declarative          | Formal announcement; effecting a change per se                          |

~~On its own, `IRG` Interrogative illocution asks a true/false question: "Is X true?" Alternatively, `IRG` can be used with certain suffixes to ask other types of questions. Likewise, `FRM-IRG` Framed interrogative illocution is translated as a true/false indirect question ("whether X is true") and can be used with certain suffixes to ask other types of questions.~~ [TODO] Interrogative illocution needs to be rethought.

## Validation

Yalbi's Validations resemble 2011 Ithkuil's original Validations more than its current ones. Note that many of these are not permitted with certain Illocutions.

| Abbreviation | Name         | Use                                                   |
|:------------:|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|    `CNF`     | Confirmative | Direct observation/knowledge; verifiable by others    |
|    `AFM`     | Affirmative  | Direct observation/knowledge; unknown verifiability   |
|    `RPT`     | Reportative  | Direct observation/knowledge; unverifiable            |
|    `INF`     | Inferential  | Inference                                             |
|    `ITU`     | Intuitive    | Intuition/feeling                                     |
|    `TS-V`    |              | Trustworthy source; verifiable                        |
|    `TS-U`    |              | Trustworthy source; unknown verifiability             |
|    `TS-N`    |              | Trustworthy source; unverifiable                      |
|    `US-V`    |              | Unknown source trustworthiness; verifiable            |
|    `US-U`    |              | Unknown source trustworthiness; unknown verifiability |
|    `US-N`    |              | Unknown source trustworthiness; unverifiable          |
|    `NS-V`    |              | Untrustworthy source; verifiable                      |
|    `NS-U`    |              | Untrustworthy source; unknown verifiability           |
|    `NS-N`    |              | Untrustworthy source; unverifiable                    |

The abbreviations for the latter nine Validations have been changed from Ithkuil to be more regular and thus easier to remember. "Name" and "use" for these nine are the same.

`CNF` Confirmative is also used as a sort of default Validation for those Illocutions where Validation is not applicable.

With `IRG` Interrogative illocution, Validation might be translated as "I [think/heard/assume] that X is the case; is it so?" (with no applicable suffix) or "I [think/heard/assume] the answer to the following question: X?" (with an applicable suffix). In general, Illocution and Validation operate in parallel rather than modifying one another.

## Perspective

Perspective has been copied almost directly from Ithkuil.

| Abbreviation | Name      | Nominal meaning         | Verbal meaning                                                  |
|:------------:|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|     `M`      | Monadic   | Singular                | An event occurring once or repeated within one context          |
|     `U`      | Unbounded | Plural (not collective) | An event occurring multiple disconnected times                  |
|     `N`      | Nomic     | All instances ever      | Universal rule (eg. "Gravity is one of the fundamental forces") |
|     `A`      | Abstract  | The idea of X, X-ness   | "Timeless" verb form (infinitives, gerundives, etc.)            |

Abstract perspective is not permitted with main verbs.

Collective nouns are shown using <some suffix that hasn't been invented yet>. [TODO]

Here are some examples of Perspective in use:

## Essence

Yalbi's Essence is identical to Ithkuil's Essence, except that `RPV` Representative has been renamed to `RPS` Representational, to better match `NRM` Normal.

| Abbreviation |       Name       | Use                                                             |
|:------------:|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `NRM`     |      Normal      | A real thing that exists (or a real event)                      |
|    `RPS`     | Representational | Something which doesn't really exist (or doesn't really happen) |

## Context

Yalbi's Context is similar to Ithkuil's Context, but without the Amalgamative or Functional. Additionally, `RPS` Representational has been renamed to `MTR` Metaphorical to reduce confusion.

| Abbreviation |     Name     | Use                                 | Example                      |
|:------------:|:------------:|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|    `EXS`     | Existential  | Default context; no special meaning | "It's a cat."                |
|    `MTR`     | Metaphorical | A metaphor for something            | "It's a (metaphorical) cat." |

Note that the Metaphorical context operates independently from Essence; one can have a metaphor for a thing which really exists, or a metaphor for a thing which does not exist.

Yalbi's `MTR` Metaphorical essence is based on to Ithkuil's `RPS` Representational context, while Yalbi's `RPS` Representational essence is based on to Ithkuil's `RPV` Representative essence. Confused yet?

## Case-frame

Yalbi uses case-frames to represent subordinate clauses. A case-frame always begins a "framed verb," a verb with [Case](#case) instead of [Illocution](#illocution) and [Validation](#validation). A case-frame ends with <some suffix that hasn't been invented yet> [TODO]. [TODO] Case-frames work exactly as they do in Ithkuil, so just go and read [JQ's explanation](http://ithkuil.net/05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o4) for now.
