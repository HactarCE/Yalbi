# Modifiers

[TODO] Clean up

_This file was automatically generated by [`compile_lexicon.py`](autogen/compile_lexicon.py). Do not make changes to this file directly; instead modify [`modifiers_template.md`](autogen/modifiers_template.md) or [`modifiers.hjson`](autogen/modifiers.hjson)._

Modifiers are the adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions of Yalbi. They are essentially the same as Ithkuil's derivational suffixes, but play an even heavier role than in Ithkuil.

Every modifier can be marked for two categories: type and degree. There are three types:

* Type 1 - Modifies the word (incidental property)
* Type 2 - Modifies the word (intrinsic property)
* Type 3 - Modifies the next modifier

There are nine degrees, which generally form spectrum from least to greatest. Some suffixes have their own specific interpretations for each of these categories, but they will usually adhere to this outline. Degree and type are both conveyed by [Vm](affixes.md#cvm).

| Vm     | Degree 1 | Degree 2 | Degree 3 | Degree 4 | Degree 5 | Degree 6 | Degree 7 | Degree 8 | Degree 9 |
|--------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Type 1 |    au    |    ai    |    oi    |    ei    |    a     |    e     |    o     |    i     |    u     |
| Type 3 |    iu    |    ia    |    io    |    ie    |    oa    |    ue    |    uo    |    ua    |    ui    |
| Type 2 |   aiu    |   aia    |   aio    |   aie    |    oe    |   aue    |   auo    |   aua    |   aui    |

A modifier can be used as a root

This modifier cannot be used in type 3. ([TODO] There should be a mechanism for using the carrier word as a modifier, but it will not be using `CAR`.) This modifier must appear at the end of a word. The last word of the carried segment is given rising tone. ([TODO] Handle quoting tonal languages?) This modifier is used in type 2 if quoting a proper noun; otherwise type 1 is used.
