# Yalbi

After trying to reform [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/) and discovering several deeply rooted morphological flaws and ambiguities, I decided to try to create my own language using my favorite parts of Ithkuil as a starting point. The result is Yalbi, an open-source morphophonological simplification and relexification of Ithkuil.
